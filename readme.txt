###  HELLO DEAR USER ###

Use dgl.py to train the data and acquire predictions
Use opendota_fetcher.py to acquire data (Make sure to rename the hardcoded file every time you
create a new file because you are risking to lose newly aquired data every time you run the code
if you do not change the name of the json destination file every time)
pretty simple instructions. Good luck.
